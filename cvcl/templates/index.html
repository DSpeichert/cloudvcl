            Steps in order to create an assignment:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Create course from <a href="{% url 'courses' %}">Courses</a></li>
            <li>Create environment definition from <a href="{% url 'envdefs' %}">Environment Definitions</a></li>
            <li>Create VM definition within <a href="{% url 'envdefs' %}">Environment Definition</a></li>
            <li>Create assignment from <a href="{% url 'assignments' %}">Assignments</a></li>
        </ol>

        </br>
        <h4>Assignments</h4>
        <p>
            This page allows you to create assignments; however, you will first need to create a new Course as well as
            an
            Environment Definition. After you have created those two components, provide the assignment name, a
            description,
            and start and end date, select the specific Course and Environment Definition from the dropdown menus to
            finish
            creating the assignment. At any given time you may edit the assignment or choose to delete it through the
            assignment list.
        </p>

        </br>
        <h4>Courses</h4>
        <p>
            This page allows you to create courses. Once you begin creating a course, you will be instructed to add
            students.
            If you forget to add a student, you may return to edit the course within the course list in order to add or
            remove students.
            You can also delete a course or multiple courses.
        </p>

        </br>
        <h4>Environments Definitions</h4>
        <p>
            This page allows you to create environment definitions. After naming the environment definition, you will
            see the option to
            create a VM Definition (it is required for you to create a VM Definition for each Environment Definition in
            order for students
            to have a working virtual machine). In the Create VM Definition page, provide a name and then select your
            image and flavor from
            the dropdown menus. You can also create additional VM Definitions or choose to edit them.
        </p>

        <h4>Assignments</h4>
        <p>
            Go here to view your current assignments. Before their end date, you will be able to launch a virtual
            environment for each assignment, allowing you to work with
            virtual machines to complete that assignment.
        </p>

        <h4>Courses</h4>

            Go here to view the details of courses that you're enrolled in as well as assignments given in those
            courses.
