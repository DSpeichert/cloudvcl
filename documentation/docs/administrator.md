# **Administrator Documentation**

## *Setup*

Welcome to the Cloud VCL Administrator guide. This guide will help you
utilize the features of Cloud VCL and manage users and functions. The
first step will be to install Django and Python. You will want to refer to official
 django documentation to [Deploy Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/deployment/).
Follow the getting-started documentation pertaining to your specific configuration. 
Once you have setting up Django and the WGGI server, you will want to install several other packages.


These packages include:
1. OpenStack SDK
2. Django Bootstrap 3
3. Pyyaml
4. Python NovaClient
5. Passlib6. Django Bootstrap 3 Datepicker 2

_Note: Ensure that you have installed the latest versions of these packages along with the lastest version of Django and Python._

### *Superuser*
To be able to administer the site and login to the admin panel, you must first create a superuser account.
In order to do this go back to the command line and type
```
python manage.py createsuperuser`
```
Press enter, and when prompted, type your username (lowercase, no spaces), email address, and password.
Don't worry that you can't see the password you're typing in â€“ that's how it's supposed to be. Just type
it in and press enter to continue. The output should look like this (where the username and email should
be your own ones):
```
(myvenv) ~/django$ python manage.py createsuperuser
Username: admin
Email address: admin@admin.com
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```
Return to your browser. Log in with the superuser's credentials you chose; you should see the Django admin
dashboard.

## *The Django admin site*

One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. If you want to know more about
Django admin, you should check [Django's Admin documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/admin/).
