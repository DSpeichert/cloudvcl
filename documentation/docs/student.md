# Student Documentation

## Overview
As a student, Cloud VCL allows you to spawn Virtual Environments
(predefined by instructors) and work with Virtual Machines to complete tasks outlined in
instructor given course assignments, usually through a course website.

Cloud VCL enables instructors to provide optimal feedback by allowing them to
access your Virtual Environments and view your Virtual Machines at any time,
even simultaneously.

<i>Note:</i> Cloud VCL does not automatically track progress and completion, so simply doing the tasks
may not satisfy the requirements of your assignments (screenshots or other proof
may be necessary).

## Accessing Cloud VCL

Cloud VCL utilizes the central authentication system of the institution that is facilitating
your course. Simply log in by clicking `Log in` on the top navigation bar. After entering and
successfully submitting your credentials to the central authentication system, your web browser
will navigate to the Cloud VCL home page.

## Accessing Courses

In Cloud VCL, the `Courses` page is simply there to organize Assignments when you
click on a Course name. Upon doing so, the active Assignments that belong to that Course will
be listed.

Click on the Assignment name to navigate to that Assignment's detail page. You can
spawn a new Environment or enter an existing one from there.

## Launching a Virtual Environment

To launch an Environment, navigate to the `Assignments` page and click on the name of
the Assignment you wish to launch an Environment for. Then simply click `LAUNCH A NEW
ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT` and wait for the Environment to load (may take several
minutes). The Environment will then open within your web browser.

If the web browser page is closed, the Environment will close but not be deleted, and you
can re-enter the Environment by following the same steps outlined above, but selecting
`ENTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT` rather than launching a new one (impossible to do, anyways).

## Deleting a Virtual Environment

If you do not currently have an Environment open on your web browser, then you can delete
an Environment by navigating to the `Assignments` page and clicking on the name of the Assignment that
has an active Environment that you want to delete. From there, click `DELETE YOUR ENVIRONMENT`. Upon
doing so, you will be directed to a confirmation page. Click `DELETE IRREVERSIBLY` to
permanently delete that Environment and all of the Virtual Machines that belong to it.

You can also delete an Environment when it is open in your web browser by clicking `DELETE ENVIRONMENT`
in the upper right hand corner of the page (confirmation is required here as well).

It is best practice to delete an Environment once you no longer need it (to free up resources), but
make sure to save proof of the work you've done before deleting an Environment because all progress
will be lost upon doing so.

## Opening and Closing Virtual Machines (VM)

Virtual Machines will be automatically loaded in your web browser when an Environment is launched.
Progress made within the Virtual Machines will be saved if the web browser page is closed (until the
Environment hosting those VMs is intentionally deleted). Remember that you can
re-enter an Environment hosting VMs if the web browser page is closed.

## Using a Virtual Machine (VM)

After launching and loading an Environment, one or more Virtual Machines with pre-loaded
operating systems will be ready to use. To switch between VMs, click on the name of one
on the green navigation bar between the console and the main navigation bar.

When you've navigated to the VM you want to work in, you can use the operating system instance loaded in
the console, but first you must click on the blue bar (with "Connected to..." text) attached above the console.

The operating system will ask you for login credentials which will be listed as "Username" and
"Password" (randomly generated) in the blue bar above the console.

To load the the console in full screen mode, select `OPEN CONSOLE IN FULL SCREEN MODE`. You
can also view the log of console output by selecting `OPEN CONSOLE LOG`.
