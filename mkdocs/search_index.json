If you aren't promoted, you will remain a student user and you won't have permission to create courses, assignments and such. \n\n\nLogging Into Cloud VCL\n\u00b6\n\n\nNavigate to your institution's Cloud VCL site and log in using your institution's credentials. You will know that you've successfully logged in when you see Logged in as YourUsername in the top right corner. Once you log in and arrive on the home page, if you see a blue text box that indicates you're an instructor, you've been successfully promoted. If not, please ask your system administrator to promote you. To log out, select the Logout button in the top right corner.\n\n\nChecking Quota and Usage\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhenever you or your student creates an instance, it will be indicated in the blue text box where it says Instance Count. Other usage details are provided (CPU, RAM, and disk) as well whenever a new instance is created. Your allocated quota is shared between you and your students in all your courses. If you exceed quota, you won't be able to create additional instances. Contact your system administrator if you want your quota increased.\n\n\nCreating a Course\n\u00b6\n\n\nVisit the Course List page by selecting the Courses tab found in the header. Create a VCL course by finding and clicking the Create Course button near the top right corner, providing a name for the desired course, and pressing Submit. Courses can be edited or deleted on the Course List page. By clicking on a course title, you will see all enrolled students and assignments given in that course if they were already added and assigned. If you choose to delete a course, all of the students and assignments tied to that course will be deleted as well; however, students will remain in the database. \n\n\nAdding Students to a Course\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhenever a course is created, you must add students yourself either manually or through the CSV upload functionality. First, click on the course title you wish to add students to on the Course List page and then press the Add Students button. You can also remove students individually after you enter the specific course title page. Also, if you wish to launch your own environment for an assignment in a course you created, you must add yourself as a student in that class. This can be done through simply providing your username in the Username field in the manual entry functionality.  \n\n\nCSV Upload\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe CSV upload functionality allows you to add multiple students to a certain course as well as to store data in Cloud VCL's database in general. Export the desired class list CSV file from Blackboard Learn and save it on your local machine. Note that Cloud VCL only requires three fields (Last Name, First Name, and Username respectively), and the CSV file generated by Blackboard Learn will have additional fields. Edit the the CSV file by removing the unneeded columns. Next, click over where it says Browse for CSV and select the class list CSV file. After selecting the correct file, press the Upload CSV and Add Students button. The students listed in the CSV will be added to the course and saved in the database.  \n\n\nManual Entry\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the case that a student is missing from the master class list file generated by Blackboard Learn and does not exist in the system, you can manually add them using this functionality. If for any reason the master class list contained only the first and last name of a student but not a username, you can just provide the username; however, the entered username must be identical to the username found in the federated authentication system. For each field, you must only provide one value (you cannot list multiple usernames, first names, and last names with every entry). After filling out the given fields, press the Add the Student button to add them to the course and database.  \n\n\nCreating an Environment Definition\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe environment definition is a virtual environment where assignments will be created through defining VMs (explained in the following section). View the Environment Definition List page by selecting the Environment Definitions tab found in the header. Create an environment definition by clicking Create Environment Definition in the top right corner and providing a name. Click on a environment definition title to view any corresponding defined VMs. Environment definitions can be edited or deleted through the Environment Definition List page. If you decide to delete an environment definition, note that all of the corresponding vm definitions will be deleted as well.\n\n\nYou can create multiple Environment Definitions for one Assignment, which can hold one or more VM Definitions.\n\n\nCreating a VM Definition\n\u00b6\n\n\nA VM definition is a template for VMs. An environment definition can have multiple VM Definitions, where each will have a flavor, image, and other configurations found below. By clicking on an environment definition title from the Environment Definition List page, you can view, create, edit, or delete the Virtual Machine Definitions that have been created. Create a new VM by clicking Create VM Definition in the top right corner. These VM Definitions will be used to load virtual machines into the environment when it's launched through an assignment. Find more details about specific fields in the creation of a VM below:\n\n\nImage\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou will have permission to select and use various OS images that your institution offers. Please select the type of image you want for your VM definition. Note that you can create and have multiple VM definitions in one environment definition. This allows your students to have multiple instances for an assignment using that particular environment definition.\n\n\nFlavor\n\u00b6\n\n\nA flavor is a predefined combination of virtual resources (CPU core count, RAM and disk space) defined in the OpenStack environment. Select the type of flavor for your VM definition but do not select a flavor that has more than what is required. Remember that each time a student creates an instance, it is using the particular combination of resources laid out in that flavor. Please refer to your institution's cloud documentation regarding flavor details and other best practices.\n\n\nConsole Log\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe console log contains all of the log entries related to the system's functioning and start up behavior. As an instructor, you will always have access to console logs; however, you may disable this feature for students when they are viewing their console by unchecking the box in the VM definition creation form. The console log can be viewed when you enter your environment by clicking the Open Log Console button. \n\n\nShell Script\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may provide a script that will be ran by the instance once it's created (e.g. create a text file or directory without having a student do it). Depending on the image you chose, you will have to provide the appropriate shebang.\n\n\nWindows\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor Windows-based images, you will be writing your scripts using Powershell (all Powershell scripts must begin with the '#ps1_sysnative' shebang). Powershell is not a compiled language but a command centric, dynamic scripting language. Learn more about Powershell scripting through this link: http://powershelltutorial.net/  \n\n\nThe example below creates a new directory named Test in another directory called VCL in the Windows file system:\n\n\n#ps1_sysnative \nNew-Item c:\\VCL\\Test -type directory\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor Linux-based images, you will be using bash scripts (all bash scripts must begin with the '#!/bin/sh' shebang). \n\n\nThe example below creates a text filed called test in the log directory:\n\n\n1\n2\n#!/bin/sh\n\nsudo touch ../var/log/test.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Packages (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nA Linux package is an item (which can take form of a script, text file, license, etc.) that installs a piece of software through the package manager into your system. Install packages by inserting one package name per line. You can search for packages and their names here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/. This feature is only for Linux-based images (NOT Windows).\n\n\nUpdate Package Lists on Boot (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy selecting yes, it will update the list of available packages and their versions, but does not install or upgrade any packages. This feature is only for Linux-based images (NOT Windows).\n\n\nUpgrade All Packages on Boot (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy selecting yes, it will upgrade to the newest versions of the packages you have. This feature is only for Linux-based images (NOT Windows).\n\n\nPerform Reboot if Required After Package Install/Upgrade (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy selecting yes, it will perform a reboot if packages are installed and upgraded. This feature is only for Linux-based images (NOT Windows).\n\n\nTimezone (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nSet a different system timezone for your instance. You may find a list of all existing timezones through this link: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man3/DateTime::TimeZone::Catalog.3pm.html. This feature is only for Linux-based images (NOT Windows). \n\n\nThis example sets the instance's timezone to New York's time:\n\n\nAmerica/New_York\n\n\n\n\n\nThis second example sets the instance's timezone to Dubai's time:\n\n\nAsia/Dubai\n\n\n\n\n\nHostname (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nHostname is used to display the system's DNS name. You can set a new hostname that will replace the hostname generated by default. The format of the generated default hostname is \nimage@VMdefinitionName\n. \n\n\nDefault User Password (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nSets the password for the default user (see table below for OS-dependant usernames). Please also refer to your institution's cloud documentation regarding usernames for additional images not found in the table below. Leave the field blank in order to disable the functionality. This feature is only for Linux-based images (NOT Windows).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Type\n\n\nUsername\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu\n\n\nubuntu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentOS\n\n\ncentos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nAdministrator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault User Public Key (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis sets the SSH public key for the default user (see table above for OS-dependant usernames or refer to your institution's cloud documentation regarding usernames for additional images used by your institution). Supported key types are: rsa, dsa, ecdsa, and ed25519. Ensure that the public key is all in one line. Visit https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys to learn more about different key types. \n\n\nExample for rsa key type:\n\n\nssh-rsa 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 user@host\n\n\n\n\n\nExample for dsa key type:\n\n\nssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAAACBAJ3hB5SAF6mBXPlZlRoJEZi0KSIN+NU2iGiaXZXi9CDrgVxTp6/sc56UcYCp4qjfrZ2G3+6PWbxYso4P4YyUC+61RU5KPy4EcTJske3O+aNvec/20cW7PT3TvH1+sxwGrymD50kTiXDgo5nXdqFvibgM61WW2DGTKlEUsZys0njRAAAAFQDs7ukaTGJlZdeznwFUAttTH9LrwwAAAIAMm4sLCdvvBx9WPkvWDX0OIXSteCYckiQxesOfPvz26FfYxuTG/2dljDlalC+kYG05C1NEcmZWSNESGBGfccSYSfI3Y5ahSVUhOC2LMO3JNjVyYUnOM/iyhzrnRfQoWO9GFMaugq0jBMlhZA4UO26yJqJ+BtXIyItaEEJdc/ghIwAAAIBFeCZynstlbBjP648+mDKIvzNSS+JYr5klGxS3q8A56NPcYhDMxGn7h1DKbb2AV4pO6y+6hDrWo3UT4dLVuzK01trwp PYp6JXTSZZ12ZaXNPz7sX9/z6pzMqhX4UEfjVsLcuF+ZS6aQCPO0ZZEa1z+EEIZSD/ykLQsDwPxGjPBqw== user@host\n\n\n\n\n\nExample for ecdsa key type:\n\n\necdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBCNnJ7lJwykFIErYDb7RcM3kyGUXjhdsZdaMbsp2NTCPr9U9AR7ucONsb8G/Dr5pzOH2J47V/ceZ7Mrfw4gOYu8= user@host \n\n\n\n\n\nExample for ed25519 key type:\n\n\nssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEXpBovNAOIz26NQ6KYp8Emn50pUds5tjiMLKXmN6hGH user@host\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate System Account for Student (Linux Only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nCreates a user in the system based on student's username and a random password (will be provided to student when they enter their instance).

It provides administrator privileges (usually available only to the root user) to normal users.  Set to 'ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' for unlimited sudo access. Here is a link for more information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo. This feature is only for Linux-based images (NOT Windows).\n\n\nCreating an Assignment\n\u00b6\n\n\nVisit the Assignment List page by selecting the Assignments tab found in the header. Create a course by clicking the Create Assignment button in the top right corner and then providing the necessary information. Each assignment will be assigned to one course and will become available to the students upon the given start date. The assignment will close and all associate Environments will be terminated based on the set end date. Assignments can be updated or deleted on the Assignment List page. Deleting an assignment will delete all existing environments that were launched by you or your students.\n\n\nCourse and Environment Definition must first be created in order for students to be assigned to an Assignment.\n\n\nEntering Your Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nOn the Assignment List page, click on an assignment title and then press the Enter Your Environment button (it will take a moment for the console to load). Once the console appears and reaches the log in screen, enter the username and password given in the blue box if you set a new user password. The console can be in full screen mode by clicking the Open Console in Full Screen Mode. If there are multiple VMs, you can easily switch from one console to another by clicking on the desired VM found in the green box. Additionally, there is information regarding when the environment was created  and the date and time of when the environment will be terminated. You can also view the console log here by clicking the Open Console Log button and delete your environment by clicking the Delete Environment button in the top right corner. All KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) functionality will work; however, audio will not work. \n\n\nPlease note: copy (CTRL+C) and paste (CTRL+V) functions do not work in the console.\n\n\nEntering a Student's Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\nOn the Assignment List page, click on the assignment title that has the student's environment you want to enter.

You will want to refer to official\n django documentation to \nDeploy Django\n.\nFollow the getting-started documentation pertaining to your specific configuration. \nOnce you have setting up Django and the WGGI server, you will want to install several other packages.\n\n\nThese packages include:\n1. OpenStack SDK\n2. Django Bootstrap 3\n3. Pyyaml\n4. Python NovaClient\n5. Passlib6. Django Bootstrap 3 Datepicker 2\n\n\nNote: Ensure that you have installed the latest versions of these packages along with the lastest version of Django and Python.\n\n\nSuperuser\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo be able to administer the site and login to the admin panel, you must first create a superuser account.\nIn order to do this go back to the command line and type\n\n\npython manage.py createsuperuser`\n\n\n\n\n\nPress enter, and when prompted, type your username (lowercase, no spaces), email address, and password.\nDon't worry that you can't see the password you're typing in \u2013 that's how it's supposed to be. Just type\nit in and press enter to continue. The output should look like this (where the username and email should\nbe your own ones):\n\n\n(myvenv) ~/django$ python manage.py createsuperuser\nUsername: admin\nEmail address: admin@admin.com\nPassword:\nPassword (again):\nSuperuser created successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to your browser.
